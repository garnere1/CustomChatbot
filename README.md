# Custom Chatbot Generator ðŸ‘½

This Flask application will generate a chatbot for the user depending on the specifications and data that they put in. The project leverages popular AI tools such as Langchain, Chroma vector database, and the OpenAI API. The custom chatbot utilizes RAG (retrieval augmented generation) to use the users uploaded files as knowedge for the chtatbot. 

Use cases of this would include recreational, internal knowledge bots, and legal analysis.

* OPENAI_API_KEY : This is your API key retrieved from OpenAI 
* UPLOAD_FOLDER : This is a local directory path where the users uploaded files will be temporarily stored

Then, run the following commands:
